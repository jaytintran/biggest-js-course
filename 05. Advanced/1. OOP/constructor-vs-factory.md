Both constructor functions and factory functions are used to create objects, but they have different syntax and behaviors. Let's break them down with examples and metaphors.

## Their returned values

Constructor functions return an object from the function. Factory functions explicitly return an object.

### Constructor Function

- Return a new instance of the function (inherits prototype)
- `this` Binding Uses this (points to the new instance)
- `this` is returned automatically
- Can return a different object (overrides `this`)

### Factory Function

- Return a plain object (not linked to a prototype)
- No this, directly returns an object
- Must explicitly return an object
- Always returns the object defined inside

### What to Use?

- If you need prototypal inheritance â†’ Use a constructor function.
- If you need flexibility and composition â†’ Use a factory function.
- ðŸš€ Factory functions are more common in modern JavaScript because they are simpler and safer.

## 1. Constructor Function

A constructor function is a special function that is used to create objects. It follows these rules:

- Starts with an uppercase letter by convention.
- Uses the new keyword to create an instance.
- this is used to assign properties.

```js
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;

  this.introduce = function () {
    console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
  };
}

const john = new Person("John", 30);
const jane = new Person("Jane", 25);

john.introduce(); // Hi, I'm John and I'm 30 years old.
jane.introduce(); // Hi, I'm Jane and I'm 25 years old.
```

### How It Works:

- `new Person("John", 30)` creates a new object.
- `this.name = name` assigns properties to the new object.
- Methods are defined inside the function.

### Metaphor:

Think of a constructor function as a blueprint for building cars:

- You use the new keyword to manufacture a new car.
- The blueprint has predefined parts (properties) like wheels, engine, and color.
- Every car created from this blueprint has its own separate properties.

## 2. Factory Function

A factory function is a regular function that returns an object without using new.

```js
function createPerson(name, age) {
  return {
    name,
    age,
    introduce() {
      console.log(`Hi, I'm ${this.name} and I'm ${this.age} years old.`);
    },
  };
}

const john = createPerson("John", 30);
const jane = createPerson("Jane", 25);

john.introduce(); // Hi, I'm John and I'm 30 years old.
jane.introduce(); // Hi, I'm Jane and I'm 25 years old.
```

### How It Works:

- Instead of this, it simply returns an object.
- No need to use the new keyword.
- Functions can be dynamically customized before returning.

### Metaphor:

A factory function is like an assembly line in a factory:

- Instead of building everything from scratch, you get a pre-assembled object.
- The factory can be customized dynamically based on input.
- More flexible and easier to modify.

## 4. Which One Should You Use?

Use a Constructor Function when:

- You are using class-like structures.
- You want to leverage prototypal inheritance.
- You want performance optimization by using prototype methods.

Use a Factory Function when:

- You need more flexibility (e.g., conditionally adding properties).
- You want to avoid new (safer for beginners).
- You want object composition rather than inheritance.

## Final Verdict: Which is Better?

- ðŸš€ Factory functions are often preferred for simplicity and flexibility, while constructor functions (especially with class) are great for prototypal inheritance and performance optimization.
