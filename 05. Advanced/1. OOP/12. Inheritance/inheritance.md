## What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a child class to inherit properties and methods from a parent class. This promotes code reusability and modular design.

## How Inheritance Works in JavaScript

JavaScript uses the extends keyword to create a child class that inherits from a parent class.
The super() function is used in the constructor of the child class to call the parent’s constructor.

## How Inheritance is Implemented

- Inheritance allows a class/subclass to inherit properties and methods from another class/superclass.
- This enables code to be reusable, and it also creates a hierarchy relationship between classes.
- In JS, inheritance can be achieved through prototype-based inheritance (before ES6), or using ES6 classes with the extends keyword.

## Why Use Inheritance?

✅ Code Reusability - Avoids duplicating code.
✅ Better Structure - Helps organize classes logically.
✅ Scalability - Makes it easier to add new features.
