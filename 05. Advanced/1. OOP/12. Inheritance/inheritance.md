## How Inheritance is Implemented

- Inheritance allows a class/subclass to inherit properties and methods from another class/superclass.
- This enables code to be reusable, and it also creates a hierarchy relationship between classes.
- In JS, inheritance can be achieved through prototype-based inheritance (before ES6), or using ES6 classes with the extends keyword.
