## OOP?

- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming style/paradigm/model that centered around the concept of objects, data, rather than function and logic.
- OOP is centered around objects, which can contain data (properties) and functions (methods) to manipulate that data.
- JavaScript is a versatile language but it's not a pure object-oriented language like Java or C++. It's a functional language, But it provides the tool and methods to implement OOP correctly.

## Key Concepts

1. Objects: are collections of key-value pairs, where keys are property names, and values can be primitives or functions.
2. Classes: are blueprints for creating objects. They encapsulate data and methods into a single entity. They are like templates, for example: creating a lot same-design shirts with different color.
3. Encapsulation: Encapsulation restricts direct access to some components of an object and allows controlled access through methods.
4. Inheritance: allows one class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
5. Polymorphism: allows methods in derived classes to override methods in the base class.
6. Abstraction: hides complex implementation details and shows only the necessary features.

## Classes

- A class is a blueprint (the car design plan).
- An object is a product made from that blueprint (an actual car).
- The constructor customizes each product during creation (assembling a specific car).
- Methods are the shared abilities of all products (what all cars can do, like driving or honking).
- Now letâ€™s say your factory makes electric cars as well as regular cars. Instead of creating a whole new blueprint from scratch, you can extend your existing Car blueprint and add special features for electric cars.

## OOP in JS?

OOP in JS refers to the practice of designing and structuring code around objects and their interactions. It allows us to model how things work in real life and their relationships using objects and classes.
