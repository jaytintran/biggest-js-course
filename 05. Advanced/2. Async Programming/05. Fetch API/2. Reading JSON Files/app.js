/* 

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. 

Itâ€™s commonly used to transmit data between a server and a web application as text. A JSON file or string represents data as a collection of key-value pairs (similar to a JavaScript object), and can contain:
- Strings
- Numbers
- Booleans
- Arrays
- Objects
- Null values

When you make an HTTP request using fetch(), the response body is returned as a raw stream of data, not in the format you expect (like a JavaScript object or array). 
This raw stream is typically in text format, but it needs to be parsed into a usable data structure (like an object or array) for your JavaScript code.

The response.json() method is built-in to the Fetch API and is used to:
1. Parse the raw text (JSON string) from the response.
2. Convert it into a JavaScript object or array, which can then be easily manipulated in your code.

Process Flow:
1. The browser sends an HTTP request (like fetch("data.json")).
2. The server responds with data in a JSON format.
3. The response object (from fetch()) is a stream of raw data.
4. To use that data in your JavaScript, you call response.json(), which:
5. Reads the stream
6. Converts it into a JavaScript object or array (depending on the structure of the JSON data)

Why Not Just Use the Response Directly?
- If you don't use response.json(), you'll be dealing with a raw response stream (or text). 
- That means you would have to manually parse the JSON text, which could be error-prone and inefficient. 
- Using response.json() simplifies that process and gives you a ready-to-use JavaScript object. 
- Without it, the data would remain as a string and wouldn't be usable for operations like accessing specific properties (data.books).
