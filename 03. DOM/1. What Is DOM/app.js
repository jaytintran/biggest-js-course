/* 
    DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. 
    
    It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, making it possible for programming languages like JavaScript to interact with the document's content, structure, and style dynamically.

    Key Points:
    - Tree Structure: DOM represents the HTML elements as a hierarchy tree of nodes
    - Nodes: elements, attributes, text, comments, and the document page itself are represented as "node"
    - Manipulation: JS can use DOM APIs to add, modify, or delete elements, and their attributes dynamically
    - Event Handling: DOM allows event listeners to interact with user actions such as clicks, keyboards presses, and mouse movements, etcs.
